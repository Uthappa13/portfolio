# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am passionate about developing intelligent, data-driven automation solutions for manufacturing.<br>
My professional journey at Unilever and Nestl√© introduced me to the transformative power of automation and the tangible business benefits it can deliver. At the University of Maryland, I am delving into ways to merge advanced machine learning tools with industry machine data, aiming to create intelligent, self-aware systems.<br>
Outside of academics and engineering, I enjoy biking and hiking, where nature's harmony inspires my belief that machines, like ecosystems, can be automated to function seamlessly.
