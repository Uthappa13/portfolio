# Industrial Automation using Ladder Logic PLC Programming  

## Project Overview

This project involves developing Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) code using Ladder Logic in RSLogix 500 for some common industrial automation scenarios.
The project focuses on simulating and implementing common automation tasks encountered in manufacturing, material handling, and process industries.

## Tech Stack
- **Ladder Logic** for programming.
- **RSLogix 500** for code development.
- **RSLogix Emulate 500** for code debugging and validation.

## Automation Scenarios Implemented
- **Digital Control Logic** - [Code](https://github.com/Uthappa13/PLC_ladderlogic/tree/main/Digital%20Control%20Logic) to control the pressure in a compressor.
- **Digital Filling Station** - [Code](https://github.com/Uthappa13/PLC_ladderlogic/tree/main/Digital%20Filling%20Station) to automate a filling station involving conveyor, hoppers, sensors and more.
- **Digital Rotameter** - [Code](https://github.com/Uthappa13/PLC_ladderlogic/tree/main/Digital%20Rotameter) to measure fluid flow in a pipeline.
- **Hourmeter** - [Code](https://github.com/Uthappa13/PLC_ladderlogic/tree/main/Hourmeter) to track runtime of a host plant.
- **Inventory Management** - [Code](https://github.com/Uthappa13/PLC_ladderlogic/tree/main/Inventory%20Management) to track inventory.
- **Multiposition Servo Application** - [Code](https://github.com/Uthappa13/PLC_ladderlogic/tree/main/Multiposition%20servo%20application) to operate a servo system.

## Methodology
- **PLC Programming in RSLogix 500**
    - Designed Ladder Logic programs with rung-based control logic using inputs and outputs.

- **Simulation & Testing in RSLogix Emulate 500**
    - Debugged and validated program execution using RSLogix Emulate 500, simulating real-world conditions.
